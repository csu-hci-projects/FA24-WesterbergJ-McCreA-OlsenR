The application starts from the main menu. When the player starts level one, they will spawn in the structure with no weapon or ammo,
but will have 100 health. The player needs to walk up the outside structure to pickup the weapon to the eliminate all the targets.
The player must avoid all hazards or they will recieve damage. To regain any health, the player must walk over a health pickup to
regain 20 health. Similar to health, if the player runs out of ammo, their weapon will not fire and they must walk over an ammo
pickup for a resupply of 10. If the player's health reaches 0, they will die and will respawn at the beginning location after four
seconds. Once the player eliminates all the targets, they will begin level two with the same objectives.
