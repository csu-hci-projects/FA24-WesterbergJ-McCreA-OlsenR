Explanation: https://youtu.be/wzUx4kUPW9M


Richey Olsen - Created the base project, implemented target tracking, implemented key challenge, implemented unlockable non-teleportable areas

Audrey McCrea - Made win level, decorated levels with static meshes, implemented sound effect for targets and gun

Jack Westerberg - Printed target tracking to screen, placed targets in the world, implemented grabbable objects

Ashley Reichel - Reload function, adjusted projectile speed, moving targets, implemented ammo tracking

The game starts in TestMap allowing the player to teleport around. There are two areas where the player can't teleport into. Once the player
grabs onto the gun, they can shoot 3 targets to unlock the first area. They can also grab the golden tube looking key and take it to the
pedestal to unlock the second locked area in the world. If the player runs out of ammo, they just press A on the controller to reload. After
the player has shot all 13 targets in the world, they get teleported into a win level.
